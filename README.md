# Used_Car_Price_Prediction
Due to pandemic, many individuals are looking towards owning a vehicle and decrease the dependency on public tansport.
But, due to the increased prices of new vehicles and financial inability, Used Car sales are picking up pace.
Therefore, there is an need for a Used Car Price Prediction system which effectively determines the price of a vehicle using various features.
In general, seller decides a price at random and buyer has no idea about the vehicle and it’s value the the market.
It could also be possible that the seller also has no idea about the vehicles’s value or the price at which he should be selling the car.
To address this problem I have developed a model which can be used to predict the price.
I used a Regression Algorithms which can provide us with a continuous value as recommeded selling price.
