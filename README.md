# Used_Car_Price_Prediction
In the recent days, due to pandemic, many individuals are looking forward to owning a vehicle who otherwise preferred public transport and decrease the dependency on public tansport.<br>
The fear of contacting virus while using a public transport, prompted consumers to owning a vehicle.  Also, used cars are mostly preferred by those who cannot afford to buy new cars at higher prices. With the increase in prices of new vehicles and considering affrordability we can observe a trend in growth of used car market.<br>
In general, a seller decides a price at random and the buyer has no idea about the vehicle and it’s value the market. 
It could also be possible that the seller also has no idea about the vehicles’s value or the price at which he should be selling the car.<br>
To address this problem I have developed a Used Car Price Prediction system which can effectively determines the price of a vehicle using various features.<br>
I used a Regression Algorithms which can provide us with a continuous value as recommeded selling price.<br>


The dataset consisting of the selling prices of different makes and models of vehicles with respect to various features such as current mileage, location of sale, age of vehicle etc. <br> I have developed a baseline machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, DecisionTreeRegressor, KNeighborsRegressor, XGBRegressor, RandomForestRegressor and choose the best out of it. Then hyper parameter tuning is performed on the selected model for final model to get best results. 

Final predictions are made on unseen data with the final model.
